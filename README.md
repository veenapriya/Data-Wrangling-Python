# Data-Wrangling-Python
Text mining and Pandas technique was used to extract, gather, assess and clean data.

- This dataset consists of 19,000 job postings from 2004 to 2015 posted on CareerCenter, an Armenian human resource portal. 
- Since postings are text documents and tend to have similar structures, text mining can be used to extract features like posting date, job title, company name, job description, salary, and more.
- Postings that had no structure or were not job-related were removed. 
- The data was originally scraped from a Yahoo! mailing group.
